You can the extension in action, by visiting the Firestore collection that was created where your Firebase Authenticated users doc will be added.

# Next step, manage the users on Rowy Admin Panel

You can now manage this collection on a [Rowy](https://www.rowy.io/)'s spreadsheet UI easily and get an instant admin panel for free. You can also invite your team members with granular access control and build any operational process such as managing subscriptions, deactivation/deletion workflow or building signup email flows etc.
