3.  Create a new Firebase Auth user in your app, and your see that document created on this collection

### (Optional) Next step, manage the Firestore collections on Rowy Admin Panel

You can now manage the Firebase Auth users collection on [Rowy](https://www.rowy.io?ref=extension) to get an instant admin panel for free. You can also invite your team members with granular access control to Rowy to build any operational process such as managing user's subscriptions, deactivation/deletion accounts or building signup email flows etc.

### Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
