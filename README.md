# Firebase Extensions by Rowy 💜

A collection of Firebase Extensions built by the Rowy team to help you build your app
faster.

## 📝 Create Firestore User Document

Use this extension to create a document in a Firestore collection of your choice whenever a new user is created in Firebase Authentication and populate it with the user fields you specify (eg email, display name, image URL, etc.).

Optionally, you can also configure the extension to delete the user's document when the user is deleted from Firebase Authentication.

You can also configure the extension to **backfill** existing users and create documents for all of them.
